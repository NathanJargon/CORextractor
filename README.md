# Tesseract Text Extractor

Tesseract Text Extractor is a tool for extracting text from images and documents. It utilizes the power of Tesseract OCR, an open-source Optical Character Recognition engine, to perform text recognition and extraction.

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL installed on your machine
- Python and required dependencies

### Installing

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
    cd your-project
    ```

2. **Set Up PostgreSQL Database:**

    - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
    - Create a new database and configure the connection parameters in `app.py`.

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

Update the database connection parameters in `app.py`:

```python
# Set up PostgreSQL connection parameters
db_params = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'database': 'your_database',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'port': '5432'
}
```

## Q&A

### A. How accurate exactly does this extract images? And will it work with different inputs?

**Since it is given to have the same documentation format, yes it will definitely work with inputs. Whatsoever, inputs with accent letters will have to manually be checked as it is inaccurate when it comes to ISO detection.**

### B. How will you implement this in a website?

**Same as usual... but actually, I am having problem with flask compatibility so I will have to deal with that and maybe I will still use flask for the database. Regardless, it is still being planned.**

### C. What library is used on this?

**The library used on this is pytesseractâ€”a popular OCR for image-to-text tool. Lastly, we used pdf-to-image module for the OCR tool to use on (it can be anything, there are a lot of library that can do this).**
